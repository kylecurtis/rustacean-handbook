Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on safety, concurrency, and memory efficiency. 

It was developed by Mozilla Research and first released in 2010. 

Rust combines the low-level control of languages like C and C++ with a strong type system and ownership model that guarantees memory safety and thread safety.

Rust's key features include (but not limited to):

- Zero-cost abstractions
- Move semantics
- Guaranteed memory safety
- Threads without data races
- Trait-based generics
- Pattern matching
- Type inference
- Minimal runtime
- Efficient C bindings

Rust is used in a wide range of applications, from embedded systems and operating systems to web browsers and game engines.
