To start programming in Rust, you need to install the Rust toolchain. The easiest way to do this is using rustup, the Rust toolchain installer.

- Visit the official Rust website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/](http://www.rust-lang.org/)

- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Open a terminal and run the following command to verify the installation:

```bash
rustc --version
```

This should print the installed version of the Rust compiler.
